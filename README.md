## What it is

Hermes Browser Extension is not a browser chatbot. It is a Chrome/Edge/Chromium side panel for the real Hermes Agent runtime. It talks to your Hermes Gateway/API server — local by default, remote when you configure a reachable URL — so it can use the models, tools, skills, sessions, memory, and MCP servers already configured in Hermes.

This repo is specifically for the **Hermes Browser Extension**: the Chrome/Edge/Chromium side-panel integration for Hermes Agent.

## Highlights

- Chrome/Edge/Chromium MV3 side panel powered by the Side Panel API.
- Connects to a configurable local or remote Hermes API server. Default: `http://127.0.0.1:8642`.
- Supports dashboard WebSocket mode when you have a signed-in remote Hermes dashboard tab and no API key.
- Auto-syncs connected Hermes providers/models, profiles, skills, sessions, and capabilities.
- Keeps runtime plugins available in the same Hermes session. For example, a connected social or messaging plugin can add account, post, and trend context while the extension supplies browser-page context.
- Shows a Hermes compatibility panel so older gateways degrade into explicit fallback/manual modes instead of broken route errors.
- Sends active tab/browser context into a persisted Hermes session, or switches to Chat only when you do not want browser context attached.
- Adds a composer-header context menu for Chat only, following the active tab, pinning a specific tab, and choosing which open tabs appear in the prompt.
- Opens as a tab-attached side panel by default, with a setting to keep the panel global across tabs.
- Opens with a keyboard shortcut (`Alt+H` by default, customizable at `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`).
- Keeps pinned-tab conversations isolated with per-tab local history and Hermes session bindings.
- Adds quick commands for common browser-context work, including `/summarize`, `/explain`, `/rewrite`, `/tabs`, and `/action-items`.
- Adds a collapsible “What Hermes saw” receipt after each sent turn for transparent context/debugging.
- Shows a live Tool Activity Strip while Hermes streams, so tool calls appear as structured runtime activity instead of raw `[tool]` markdown appended into answers.
- Classifies upstream Hermes runtime/tool exceptions as connected-with-warning diagnostics when the gateway is reachable, including the known Python `NoneType`/`int()` traceback class.
- Captures active tab title/URL, open tabs, selected text, readable page text, metadata, headings, forms, links, and buttons where available.
- Supports voice dictation through Hermes audio transcription when available, with Browser speech fallback when the connected runtime does not expose STT.
- Wraps webpage text as untrusted context before sending it to Hermes.
- Streams Hermes responses and falls back to non-streaming chat when needed.
- Includes Desktop-style appearance settings: Light/Dark/System mode plus Nous, Midnight, Ember, Mono, Cyberpunk, and Slate themes.
- Includes a localhost agent picker for switching between trusted local Hermes API gateway ports.
- No `debugger`, `nativeMessaging`, click/type/form-submit, cookies, history, bookmarks, downloads, or browser-control permissions in v0.1.

## Requirements

- Hermes Agent installed and working.
- Hermes Gateway/API server enabled locally or on a reachable remote machine.
- Node.js 20+.
- Chrome, Edge, Brave, Comet, or another Chromium browser with Side Panel API support (Chrome 114+ baseline).

## Quick start

### 1. Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abundantbeing/hermes-browser-extension.git
cd hermes-browser-extension
npm install
npm run build
```

The loadable extension is generated at:

```text
dist/
```

### 2. Load unpacked in Chrome/Edge

1. Open `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select this repo's `dist/` folder — not the repo root and not `extension/`.
5. Pin/click the Hermes extension icon to open the side panel.

After code updates, run `npm run build` again and click **Reload** on the Hermes Browser Extension card in the browser extensions page.

## Connect to Hermes

### Local API server

Local-only is the safest default. Put this in `~/.hermes/.env` on the machine running Hermes:

```bash
API_SERVER_ENABLED=true
API_SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1
API_SERVER_PORT=8642
API_SERVER_KEY=<your-api-server-key>
API_SERVER_CORS_ORIGINS=chrome-extension://<your-extension-id>
```

Start or restart the gateway:

```bash
hermes gateway run
```

Verify the API server:

```bash
HERMES_GATEWAY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8642
HERMES_API_TOKEN='<your-api-server-key-or-browser-token>'
curl "$HERMES_GATEWAY_URL/health"
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $HERMES_API_TOKEN" "$HERMES_GATEWAY_URL/v1/models"
```

Then in the extension side panel:

1. Click **Connect to Hermes** and approve locally if your Hermes Desktop/gateway supports the approval flow.
2. If approval is not available yet, click **Manual setup**.
3. Choose **Local gateway**.
4. Use Gateway URL `http://127.0.0.1:8642`.
5. Paste your scoped browser token or `API_SERVER_KEY`.
6. Click **Test connection**, then **Save settings**.
7. Open a normal `https://` page and ask: `Summarize this page in one sentence.`

### Remote API server

For a remote Hermes machine, bind the API server to a reachable trusted interface and keep CORS narrow:

```bash
API_SERVER_ENABLED=true
API_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_SERVER_PORT=8642
API_SERVER_KEY=<your-api-server-key>
API_SERVER_CORS_ORIGINS=chrome-extension://<your-extension-id>
```

Use a private same-LAN/Tailscale/VPN host with HTTP, or put the API server behind a trusted HTTPS reverse proxy for public/proxied access. Do **not** expose the Hermes API server naked to the public internet. The Hermes API server can access the real Hermes runtime and tools.

Examples:

```text
http://192.168.1.50:8642
http://hermes-desktop.local:8642
https://hermes.example.com
```

In the extension side panel:

1. Choose **Remote gateway**.
2. Paste the remote API URL, including `http://` or `https://`.
3. Paste the API key/browser token.
4. Click **Test connection**.

With a key present, Remote means **Remote API server** and does not force HTTPS. With the key blank, Remote means **Remote dashboard WebSocket** and requires an `https://` dashboard URL.

### Remote dashboard mode, no API server

If you run Hermes elsewhere and only expose the OAuth-gated dashboard, select **Remote**, enter the dashboard's `https://` URL, and leave the API key blank. With no key, the extension connects over the dashboard's `/api/ws` socket instead of the REST API server.

Auth uses a single-use WebSocket ticket minted from a signed-in dashboard tab:

- Open the dashboard URL in a normal browser tab and sign in, and keep that tab around.
- The extension mints the ticket first-party from that tab, then opens the socket.
- **Test connection** opens the socket and loads models, which confirms the whole path.

Limitations in this mode: image attachments are inline-only, and the skills/profiles lists are unavailable because those are REST-only and the dashboard's REST surface is not reachable cross-origin.

## What syncs after connection

After connection, the side panel loads from the connected Hermes gateway:

- `/v1/models` — all providers/models Hermes can enumerate, including provider-qualified IDs.
- `/api/sessions` — recent Hermes sessions grouped by source.
- `/v1/skills` — slash-command skill suggestions in the composer.
- `/v1/profiles` — profile picker when the gateway exposes profile metadata.
- `/v1/capabilities` — feature flags such as audio transcription and Browser upload support.

The DOM/context chip should show a non-zero page-context count on normal readable pages. Browser internal pages such as `chrome://extensions` are intentionally restricted.

## Install with Hermes / Computer Use

You can ask Hermes to help install it:

```text
Install Hermes Browser Extension from https://github.com/abundantbeing/hermes-browser-extension. Clone it, run npm install, run npm run build, then use computer use to open chrome://extensions, enable Developer mode, load the dist folder unpacked, and help me connect it to my local or remote Hermes Gateway API server. Do not reveal, print, screenshot, or commit my API key.
```

## Security model

Hermes Browser Extension is intentionally conservative in v0.1:

- Local API server by default; remote API server support requires an explicit URL, token, and CORS allowlist.
- Strong bearer/API key required for API access.
- Page content is wrapped as untrusted context before it reaches Hermes.
- Read-only browser context capture: no click, type, form-submit, checkout, download, or browser-control behavior.
- No `debugger`, `nativeMessaging`, `cookies`, `history`, `downloads`, or `bookmarks` permissions.
- Restricted pages include browser internals, extension pages, and obvious banking/crypto/password/payment/health/government-tax categories.

See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md), [`PERMISSIONS.md`](PERMISSIONS.md), [`DATA-FLOW.md`](DATA-FLOW.md), and [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md) for details.

## Troubleshooting

### I loaded the extension but nothing works

Make sure you loaded `dist/`, not the repo root. The selected folder must contain `manifest.json` directly.

### Chrome still shows an older version after updating

The browser is still using an old unpacked folder or an unpacked extension card that was not reloaded. For v0.1.8, the source manifest, built `dist/` manifest, and release archive should all contain `manifest.json` version `0.1.8`.

Fix:

1. Extract/download the v0.1.8 release or run `npm run build` locally.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`.
3. On the Hermes Browser Extension card, click **Reload**.
4. If it still shows an older version, click **Remove**, then **Load unpacked** again and select the fresh v0.1.8 `dist/` folder.
5. Click **service worker** / **Inspect views** only for debugging; it is not the version source.

### The side panel says it cannot connect

Check that Hermes Gateway/API server is running and reachable from the browser:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8642/health
# or, for remote mode:
curl http://<trusted-remote-host>:8642/health
```

If `/v1/models` fails, check `API_SERVER_KEY`, the extension's stored API key/browser token, and `API_SERVER_CORS_ORIGINS`. For remote mode, the browser extension origin (`chrome-extension://<id>`) must be allowlisted on the Hermes machine.

### The side panel shows a runtime warning but still says connected

v0.1.8 separates gateway reachability from upstream Hermes runtime/tool failures. If `/health` works but Hermes raises a runtime traceback, the Browser stays connected and shows the warning instead of turning the whole connection red.

For tracebacks like `int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a real number, not 'NoneType'`, check the Hermes Agent logs on the machine running the gateway. If the traceback mentions `computer_use` or `cua-driver`, run:

```bash
hermes computer-use doctor
```

That diagnostic belongs to the Hermes runtime/tool layer, not to Browser extension packaging or Chrome permissions.

### Native Hermes computer use is not working

Hermes Browser Extension does not request browser-control permissions and does not drive pages itself. Native desktop control comes from Hermes Agent's `computer_use` toolset via `cua-driver`.

On the machine running Hermes, verify computer use directly:

```bash
hermes tools list
hermes computer-use status
hermes computer-use doctor
```

If `doctor` says the driver is missing:

```bash
hermes computer-use install
```

Then start a fresh Hermes session with the toolset enabled:

```bash
hermes -t computer_use chat
```

Common blockers from the Hermes docs:

- Windows over SSH runs in Session 0 and cannot see the interactive desktop; use the console/RDP session or the cua-driver Windows autostart pattern.
- Elevated/admin windows cannot be driven by a normal-integrity Hermes process on Windows.
- macOS needs Accessibility + Screen Recording permissions.
- Linux needs a reachable X11/Wayland display and AT-SPI.

### The DOM chip says `0 chars`

Open a normal `https://` page and refresh context. Browser internal pages (`chrome://`, `edge://`, extension pages, devtools, etc.) are restricted by design.

### Microphone says blocked or voice dictation does not start

Chromium side panels can suppress microphone permission prompts. Hermes Browser Extension handles this with capability-gated voice modes:

- **Hermes STT** when the connected Hermes runtime advertises audio transcription.
- **Browser speech fallback** when Hermes STT is unavailable and Chromium exposes Web Speech.
- A visible **Hermes Voice Dictation** tab when the side panel cannot capture the mic directly.

Suggested flow:

1. Click the mic button in the side panel.
2. If the side panel cannot capture the mic, a **Hermes Voice Dictation** tab opens.
3. In that tab, click **Start dictation**. This click is the permission gesture Chromium expects.
4. Speak, then click **Stop + transcribe** or **Stop speech** depending on the active mode.
5. The transcript is sent back to the side panel composer automatically.

If Chromium still says the mic is blocked, click **Open microphone settings** in the voice tab and set Microphone to **Allow** for `chrome-extension://<the Hermes extension id>/`, then return to the voice tab and try again.

### The first-run Connect flow is unavailable

Use **Manual setup** with your local/remote Gateway URL and API key. The native Desktop approval flow is still evolving during alpha.

## GitHub PR/Issue auto-review

This repo includes two Hermes review runners:

- `npm run review:watch` — local poller for open PRs/issues. This works now from a machine that can reach Hermes and is authenticated with `gh`.
- `npm run review:event` — GitHub-event runner for future GitHub Actions/webhook wiring. It expects `GITHUB_EVENT_NAME`, `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`, and `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`.

The local poller checks open PRs and issues, computes a stable signature from PR head SHA or issue title/body, and only reviews changed targets. It upserts one bot comment per PR/issue with a stable marker. PR diffs and issue bodies are treated as untrusted input.

Local setup:

```bash
# Uses gh auth token, local API_SERVER_KEY from ~/.hermes/.env,
# and http://127.0.0.1:8642 by default.
npm run review:watch
```

Optional overrides:

```bash
HERMES_REVIEW_REPO=abundantbeing/hermes-browser-extension
HERMES_REVIEW_GATEWAY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8642
HERMES_REVIEW_API_KEY=<api-server-key-or-scoped-token>
HERMES_REVIEW_MAX_TARGETS=3
HERMES_REVIEW_STATE_FILE=~/.hermes/hermes-browser-review-state.json
```

For a GitHub-hosted Actions runner later, `HERMES_REVIEW_GATEWAY_URL` must be reachable from GitHub. A runner cannot reach `http://127.0.0.1:8642` on your personal machine; use a remote Hermes API server behind Tailscale/VPN/HTTPS or a self-hosted GitHub runner on the same network. Pushing `.github/workflows/*` also requires a GitHub token with `workflow` scope.

Dry-runs:

```bash
npm run review:watch:dry-run

GITHUB_EVENT_NAME=pull_request_target \
GITHUB_EVENT_PATH=./event.json \
GITHUB_REPOSITORY=abundantbeing/hermes-browser-extension \
GITHUB_TOKEN=<github-token> \
npm run review:event:dry-run
```

## Development

```bash
npm test
npm run check:js
npm run check:manifest
npm run verify
npm run build
npm run package
```
